Adds useful classes for getting the most out of Wordpress' advanced CMS features

== Description ==

This framework is a collection of classes and functions for handling advanced custom post types cases. With just a few pre-populated arrays, it can create custom post types, their labels, metaboxes, save routines, and any custom taxonomies.

NOTE: this began life as an internal development tool, and as such, does not have much (if any documentation) just yet. It's not really end-user friendly in its current state. So if you're not running a site I have built for you personally, you probably don't need it ;-)

== Installation ==

Upload, activate, have a drink... but first, install and activate Scribu's excellent Posts 2 Posts plugin, which this framework requires!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need this plugin? =

If you're using a theme or setting up a site I built for you, then very likely, yes...

Otherwise, not yet ;-)

= I updated my call to soma_init_taxonomy() and added new terms, but why aren't they appearing? =

deactivate and reactivate your theme/plugin that contains the function call, as term generation only happens upon activation...

== Changelog ==

= 1.6 =
* NEW somatic_framework_options settings container (serialized array of default options)
* NEW api function: soma_set_option() - allows easy manipulation of somatic_framework_options in wp_options table
* NEW global var: $soma_options - quick checking of current options with DB query
* NEW settings page (under Tools) to toggle debug mode, plugin dependencies, dashboard widgets, bottom admin bar, editor metaboxes, admin menus, and more
* NEW daily cron task, use action hook 'soma_daily_event'
* NEW csv export class, included in trunk but not ready for prime time
* NEW plugin checks for minimum wordpress version, aborts otherwise...
* NEW for CPT's with show_in_nav_menu = true, an item will be available at the top of the "view all" tab in the CPT panel of Appearance->Menus. Adding that to the menu will create a custom nav menu item configured to display CPT archives
* NEW arg 'create_nav_item' for soma_init_type() - replaces the 'navbar' arg
* CHANGE: custom post type nav items - instead of filtering the nav menu output and tacking our CPT's on, we're actually creating real nav menu items in the DB. Then you can go to Appearance->Menus and re-order that item like any other
* REMOVED filter: soma_custom_type_nav_position, as the CPT nav items aren't being generated by somaTypes::custom_type_nav() anymore
* DEPRECATED: old options soma_meta_prefix, soma_meta_serialize, soma_debug - store your values in the new somatic_framework_options settings container. ex: update_option('somatic_framework_options', array('meta_prefix', '_foo'));
* CHANGE: keycommand for showing/hiding the debug bar panels is now "\" for minimized and alt+"\" for maximized view
* sexy settings link right on the plugins page!
* improved the example php config templates
* better handling of missing metabox config data in add_boxes()
* independent handling of current nav menu item classes with fix_nav_classes()

= 1.5.1 =
* fixed fatal error in checking for Kint when debug mode is enabled...

= 1.5 =
* included the awesome Kint PHP debugger v.32 (http://code.google.com/p/kint/)
* integration with the Debug Bar plugin for maximum awesomeness (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/debug-bar/)
* when Debug Bar is installed, hit the ";" or "'" keys to toggle the debug panel in maximized or partial view
* NEW API function: soma_dump() - outputs data to screen (or to the Debug Bar panel, much nicer!)
* re-enabled admin bar on front-end (had been disabled globally, overriding user options)
* NEW option: soma_debug - controls inclusion of Kint classes, Debug Bar hooks, and various debugging things. Defaults to off.
* NEW js and css for injection on the public side of wordpress
* cleaned up all PHP Notice warnings! go ahead and turn on WP_DEBUG...

= 1.4.4 =
* corrected critical bug introduced by 1.4.3 fixes - save routines now work again...

= 1.4.3 =
* fixed unnecessary suicide when trying to save a post/page if no custom metabox definitions exist yet...
* now fully compliant with WP guidelines! ;-)

= 1.4.2 =
* fixed unreliable usage of isset() for array keys in soma_init_type. Wasn't registering user parameters for navbar and sortable properly [facepalm]
* NEW somaFunctions::is_blank() for checking whether variable/array key is actually blank or just set to "0" or false

= 1.4.1 =
* soma_external_media() now supports SoundCloud URLs!
* fixed inconsistencies with metabox handling of media types. Make sure data=attachment and type=media
* fixed problem with external media metabox colorbox iframes (no dimensions were given)
* fixed colorbox trigger play icon to be more reliable
* mediaelement.js replaces jPlayer when displaying media attachments in admin metaboxes (though at the moment requires wp plugin http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/media-element-html5-video-and-audio-player/)

= 1.4 = 
* NEW metabox field type: external_media - Text field that accepts vimeo or youtube URLs, and fetches that video's metadata via each site's public API. Also saves that response in post_meta for quicker retrieval.
* NEW metabox field type: external_image - Text field that accepts image URL, and can import the image as an attachment, also setting imported image as Featured Image
* NEW API function: soma_external_media() - parses URL from either youtube or vimeo, returns an array with basic metadata, including ID, title, thumbnails - optionally imports source image to local library and sets the post_thumbnail!. NOTE: desired video must not be private, password-protected, or have embedding disabled by the owner!
* NEW internal function: somaFunctions::attach_external_image() - sideloads an external image URL into the wordpress media library and attaches to a post
* updated colorbox.js to 1.3.19
* fixed broken url for jquery UI smoothness css
* fixed link output in custom_type_nav() for when the custom post type slug includes variables for taxonomy permalinks
* NEW filter: soma_custom_type_nav_position, for determining with the nav items that are automatically generated for custom post types are placed before or after the existing menu items. Defaults to "after" (return "before" via filter to change)
* fixed soma_init_type ignoring navbar=false and inserting menu item anyway
* fixed broken css on Sort Order pages
* consolidated metabox description row code (too much duplication)
* a smattering of other tweaks, enhancements, and bugfixes..

= 1.3.2 =
* admin footer text output
* fixed numeric field input to allow colon (:)

= 1.3.1 =
* fixed problem with setting the option soma_meta_serialize, which needs to be passed 0 or 1, not boolean true or false (false resulted in empty option_value, which broke everything)
* NOTE: when using soma_asset_meta(), don't include the prefix when specifying the post_meta key! it gets added automatically. Just use the exact ID you gave when declaring the field in  soma_metabox_data()
* NEW API function: soma_singular_term() for retrieving the term of a taxonomy that is meant to have only one value at a time.
* NEW documentation - example PHP code in the doc folder, to help demonstrate how to use the somatic framework

= 1.3 =
* added 'navbar' argument to soma_init_type to choose whether to display a nav menu item to the primary navbar for custom post types [default: true]
* added 'sortable' argument to soma_init_type to choose whether to make items manually sortable (instead of automatically sorting by date) [default: false]
* post meta keys are now stored individually by default. If you want to store all metadata per post as a serialized array in a single key, you need to set the option 'soma_meta_serialize' to true
* the default post meta key name prefix is "_soma" (what you give as the ID for a metabox field is added to it). If you want a custom prefix, you need to set the option 'soma_meta_prefix' to "_YOUR_PREFIX"
* admin type sorting page rows fit content better
* NEW API function: soma_asset_meta() for manipulating post_meta (abstracts the core functions to better handle serialization cases)
* NEW API function: soma_featured_image() for retrieving everything you could possibly need to know about the featured image (post thumbnail)
* in edit listing columns, the checkbox column is always included now, so don't need to pass it in soma_init_type column array
* fixed a query parsing filter that was forcing everything to order by menu_order ASC, no matter what...
* had forgotten to actually enqueue jquery UI datepicker and slider js and css this whole time <facepalm>
* added button to clear date values when using datepicker

= 1.2.1 =
* revised somaFunctions::fetch_connected_items() to handle p2p plugin evolution
* note: must pass the p2p type ID and *not* the post_type anymore! Please revise all calls to fetch_connected_items()!
* When passing "p2p" field data with soma_metabox_data(), you must also pass "p2pname" for the unique registered p2p connection ID and "type" (p2p-list or p2p-thumb) for output
* cleaned up save routines, stripslashes bugs
* metabox type "richtext" now uses the new WP3.3 wp_editor() function (multiple rich editors possible, yay!)
* NEW metabox type "html" uses the new WP3.3 wp_editor() function, but without the visual editor
* metabox type "editor" removed - use "richtext" instead with ID of "post_content" and data of "core" if you're trying to replace the core post editor (just make sure to NOT include "editor" in the post type support!)
* some css tweaks in the editor to keep up with WP3.3
* added action hook "soma_column_data" to inject custom post type column data output

= 1.2 =
* added listings for public custom post types and taxonomies to the Right Now dashboard widget
* added ability to pick future years (+10) in the basic date picker

= 1.1.1 =
* bugfix: soma_metabox_data was expecting unecessary array keys
* bugfix: legacy date selectors couldn't handle mysqldate format
* bugfix: somaFunctions::fetch_featured_image() couldn't handle when wp uploads were organized in year-month folders. Also couldn't handle when all the sizes (thumb, medium, full) didn't exist... ugh...

= 1.1 =
* created public functions in api.php to initialize things like custom post type, taxonomy, terms, and custom metabox data
* added flush_rewrite_rules to plugin activation
* added contextual help customization per CPT
* generate custom icon paths automatically based on CPT slug, just provide URL to directory where they're located, image name scheme "slug-menu-icon.png"

= 1.0 =
* first public release on wordpress.org

= 0.6 =
* added jPlayer for metaboxes - meta type Audio or Video
* asset_meta() can be set to serialize or not post_meta via somaMetaboxes::$meta_serialize var (default true), can also be overridden via function params

* added arg to init_taxonomy to automatically hide metaboxes on custom taxonomies

= 0.5 =
* added file upload field type
* added attachment gallery display field type
* added colorbox lightbox viewing for images, pdf, doc, xls, ppt (with google doc iframe viewer)
